> Atonement Of The Forefathers

Prosperous were the ones who made peace the essence of their society. These were the biggest fruits from your forefathers, O Jasper! Verily, peace is the most blissful contribution we can make to the welfare and rights of every being. Indeed, peace is the desire of every heart, the hope of every nation and dominion, the promise of every politician; honest or deceitful, a pillar of every supplication and the outward beat of every religious agenda, Peace is the ultimate response and antagonist to many evils and suffering in life. Where evil, corrupts, destroys and tears apart, peace strengthens and restores. 

May Alterra remain steadfast in its goal of peace and eternally prevail through its dominion and beyond. Verily, peace is a concept that is multifaceted and extends beyond the mere absence of conflict or violence. It is a state of harmony and tranquillity that allows individuals and communities to thrive and flourish. It is the foundation upon which relationships are built, innovations are created, and humankind works towards a better future for all. 

However, peace is often elusive and fragile, constantly threatened by those who seek to sow discord and unrest through their actions and ideologies. Therefore, it should be the duty of every one of us to strive towards creating a more peaceful world, through actions both grand and small. This can be achieved through diplomacy and dialogue, community service and activism, or simply through the choice to act with kindness and understanding in our daily interactions. We all have the power to promote and nurture peace. Let us be ambassadors of peace and do our part in creating a world that is more just, compassionate, and harmonious. For it is only through peace that we can truly flourish and reach our full potential as human beings.

So it was said to the objectional ones; Uphold peace and unity as a quintessence of the mind. Such are multitudes of people who diverted from the path of serenity and righteousness. Among them were the corrupt and unjust. Their resultant individuality strikes similitude to a discontent shell devoid of any goodness, Their souls were sealed from tasting the greatest of nectar of life. 

Jasper replied, “What is this nectar O Sage?” So he _smiled_ broadly, content at his speech, and propounded:

Verily, it is this nectar's fragrance which takes multiple forms. Indeed, cloven from the fragrance of this nectar is the liberation of oneself from the wickedness of life. From the early dawn of humankind; liberated were those among you who's thinking rose beyond the nationalist borders of their nations. Surely, it is the prosperity of the mind that is found in liberation from the ignorance of humankind, and it's arrogance. Devoid of liberation, where those who indulged their minds with transgressions of their forefathers. Such were those who valued the enterprise over humanity, dogma over truth and racism over unity. They enveloped themselves in arrogance outwardly, but inwards we're truly in despair. 


Upon this epiphany, the learned inquired, “O Exalted! From where is this hatred and ignorance rented asunder?” Indeed, those among you emotional devotionalism


# <u> The Two Great Minds </u>

O Jasper, Among my kind therein abided two great minds Yerxa and Orion, whose hearts yearned greatly for fruition. Their excellence and worth reached the heavens, Yet fate denied them praise and fruits of acknowledgement. Their minds were seized by perseverance and vigour, so they sought the seeds of an eternal kingdom of contentment. In the distance, their eyes gazed upon an ocean of distinction, thereby laid water like sparkling silver and residing above them was a Dyson sphere like burning gold. Upon this horizon was the enchanting allure of success; its delicate rays were endowed with the vibrant hues flowing through the tapestry of existence.

As the days followed, cloven from the sight was the divergence of two paths. Blessed are they (Orion) who remains steadfast in passion, humility, and stridence; such people propounded “Verily this is nothing more than fleeting desires” Indeed, whoever (Yerxa) inequitably seeks against that, then those are the vanquished themselves. Within the soul of Yerxa beholding despair grew ignorance, arrogance, and denial as he increasingly chased the enchanting allure of success. 

“They looked at you as the strangest of creation and; it was at that moment you connected closer with cosmos itself; What can be better than becoming closer to the highest order of creation? Indeed, take pride in your life you lived with imperfections than the miserable life of those who imitated other people's perfections.”

Let the pillar of morality be based from the wellbeing while not objective; it is foolish for one to seek beyond what governs the physical being; for it is without this wellbeing that the being ceases.

As you find yourself in servitude to man, beware of the attachment to the fruits of your servitude. Verily, those who seized their efforts only for the fruits of their servitude will eventually find themselves in pure disbelief and pain.

An individual's internal outlook and destiny is chained to the extent of his belief. The one who performs his rightful servitude in fear and nervousness has created for himself his own chain.

Therein mankind will you find such a grave and hidden illness withheld from the eyes of the common folk that are informed not. Indeed, it is they who are negligent in their compassion that creates a society devoid of harmony. Within such a society is a biased distribution of injustice. The perpetrators of this injustice were those who were denied affection from their benefactors. And who is more among the unjust than he who fabricates this deviation of social affection. 

Therein, among the criminals and tyrants, you will find multitudes of tormented souls who permitted for themselves a kindling of darkness. You will not find any people among them who embraced _affection_ for the ones who contravene their transgressions.  O Learned! Be merciful onto those deprived of mercy, and lower to them the pennon of rehabilitation out of mercy, for indeed your blaze of scarring vengeance will be annihilated. Among the society that upheld this judiciary prevailed in their reformations like the nations of Scandinavia.
