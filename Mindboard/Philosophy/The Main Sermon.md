> Atonement Of The Forefathers

Prosperous were the ones who made peace the essence of their society. These were the biggest fruits from your forefathers. Verily, nothing is more exalted upon a blessed nation than peace (Literally: The Quintessence). Wonderous is the matter of peace, for it is surely the most blissful contribution we can make to the welfare and rights of every being. Indeed, peace is the desire of every heart, the hope of every nation and dominion, the promise of every politician; honest or deceitful, a pillar of every supplication and the outward beat of every religious agenda, Peace is the ultimate response and antagonist to many evils and suffering in life. Where evil, corrupts, destroys and tears apart, peace strengthens and restores. 

May the wise (Alterra) remain steadfast in its goal of peace and eternally prevail through its dominion and beyond. Say to them, peace is a concept that is embodied in multitudes of forms and extends beyond the mere absence of conflict or violence. It is a state of harmony and tranquillity that allows oneself and it's benefactors to thrive and flourish. It is the foundation upon which relationships are built, innovations are created, and humankind works towards a better future for all. 

However, fragility is the quintessence of peace. It is thy who is constantly threatened from those who seek to sow discord and unrest through their actions and ideologies. 

It is your obligation and duty to strive towards creating a more peaceful world, through actions both grand and small. Oh, peace how may I uphold you?

O best among you, five kinds of pious men render devotional service unto Me—the diplomat, the rightful activist , the infectious desirer of wisdom and kindness, the inquisitive, and he who is searches for thy knowledge of the Absolute (Non-platonic form of reality). And those who strive in my path will render forth a world that is more just, compassionate, and harmonious.

So it was said to the objectional ones; Uphold peace and unity as a quintessence of the mind. Such are multitudes of people who diverted from the path of serenity and righteousness. Among them were the corrupt and unjust. Their resultant individuality strikes similitude to a discontent shell devoid of any goodness, Their souls were sealed from tasting the greatest of nectar of life. 

Jasper replied, “What is this nectar O Sage?” So he _smiled_ broadly, content at his speech, and propounded:

Verily, it is this nectar's fragrance which takes multiple forms. Indeed, cloven from the fragrance of this nectar is the liberation of oneself from the wickedness of life. From the early dawn of humankind; liberated were those among you who's thinking rose beyond the nationalist borders of their nations. Surely, it is the prosperity of the mind that is found in liberation from the ignorance of humankind, and it's arrogance. Devoid of liberation, where those who indulged their minds with transgressions of their forefathers. Such were those who valued the enterprise over humanity, dogma over truth and racism over unity. They enveloped themselves in arrogance outwardly, but inwards we're truly in despair. 


Upon this epiphany, the learned inquired, “O Exalted! From where is this hatred and ignorance rented asunder?” Indeed, those among you emotional devotionalism [continue pondering and brainstorm ideas of this origin for emotional devotionalism]

# <u> The Two Great Minds </u>

> Mental Reminder/Origin Of Story: You were thirsty for water one night and were upset about FOMO where you were reminded about a quote of planting the seeds. Expand and ponder further when free about the origin of human desire for ego, and it's destruction on the inner self (the self-atman -> Buddhi)

O Jasper, Among my kind therein abided two great minds Yerxa and Erza, whose hearts yearned greatly for fruition. Their excellence and worth reached the heavens, Yet fate denied them praise and fruits of acknowledgement. Their minds were seized by drive and vigour, so they sought the seeds of an eternal state of contentment. In the distance, their eyes gazed upon an ocean of distinction, thereby laid water like sparkling silver and residing above them was a Dyson sphere like burning gold. Upon this horizon was the enchanting allure of success; its quintessence was endowed with the vibrant hues flowing through the tapestry of existence.

As the days followed, cloven from the sight was the divergence of two paths. Blessed are they (Erza) who remains steadfast in passion, humility, and stridence; such people propounded “Verily this is nothing more than fleeting desires” Indeed, whoever (Yerxa) inequitably seeks against that, then those are the vanquished themselves. Within the soul of Yerxa beholding despair grew ignorance, arrogance, and denial as he increasingly chased the enchanting allure of success.

Let the pillar of morality be based from the wellbeing while not objective; it is foolish for one to seek beyond what governs the physical being; for it is without this wellbeing that the physical being itself ceases.

As you find yourself in servitude to man, beware of the attachment to the fruits of your servitude. Verily, those who seized their efforts only for the fruits of their servitude will eventually find themselves in pure disbelief and pain.

An individual's internal outlook and destiny is chained to the extent of his belief. The one who performs his rightful servitude in fear and nervousness has created for himself his own chain.

Therein mankind will you find such a grave and hidden illness withheld from the eyes of the common folk that are informed not. Indeed, it is they who are negligent in their compassion that creates a society devoid of harmony. Within such a society is a biased distribution of injustice. The perpetrators of this injustice were those who were denied affection from their benefactors. And who is more among the unjust than he who fabricates this deviation of social affection. 

Herein, among the criminals and tyrants, you will find multitudes of tormented souls who permitted for themselves a kindling of darkness. You will not find any people among them who embraced _affection_ for the ones who contravene their transgressions.  O Learned! Be merciful onto those deprived of mercy, and lower to them the wings of rehabilitation out of mercy, for indeed your blaze of scarring vengeance will be annihilated. Among the societies that upheld this judiciary prevailed in their reformations like the Scandinavian nations.

The Divine Pendulum 

Mental reminder: This was by coincidence similar to dharma so explore the idea of balance permeating social existence. 

O Exhalted! Bestow onto me that which of which is not upheld in your dominion.
