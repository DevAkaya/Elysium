> Harmony Of The Universe 

O You who upholds righteousness! Let it be known in clear; the order of duality, The casual chain of progression that reigns the harmony of creation. 


> Atonement Of The Forefathers

Prosperous where the one made peace the essence of their society. These were the biggest fruits from your forefathers, O Jasper! Verily, peace is the most blissful contribution we can make to the welfare and rights of every being Indeed, peace is the desire of every heart, the hope of every nation and dominion, the promise of every politician; honest or deceitful, a pillar of every supplication and the outward beat of every religious agenda, Peace is the ultimate response and antagonist to many evils and suffering in life. Where evil, corrupts, destroys and tears apart, peace strengthens and restores. 

May Alterra remain steadfast in its goal of peace and eternally prevail through its dominion and beyond. Verily, peace is a concept that is multifaceted and extends beyond the mere absence of conflict or violence. It is a state of harmony and tranquility that allows individuals and communities to thrive and flourish. It is the foundation upon which relationships are built, innovations are created, and we work towards a better future for all. 

However, peace is often elusive and fragile, constantly threatened by those who seek to sow discord and unrest through their actions and ideologies. Therefore, it should be the duty of every one of us to strive towards creating a more peaceful world, through actions both grand and small. This can be achieved through diplomacy and dialogue, community service and activism, or simply through the choice to act with kindness and understanding in our daily interactions. We all have the power to promote and nurture peace. Let us be ambassadors of peace and do our part in creating a world that is more just, compassionate, and harmonious. For it is only through peace that we can truly flourish and reach our full potential as human beings.


So it was said to the objectional ones; Uphold peace and unity as a quintessence of the mind. Such are multitudes of people who diverted from the path of serenity and righteousness. Among them were the corrupt and unjust leaders. Their resultant individuality strikes similitude to a discontent shell devoid of any goodness, Their spirits were sealed from tasting the greatest of nectar of life. 

Jasper replied, “What is this nectar O Sage?” A smile of contentment was cloven from his face from which he propounded:

Verily, it is this nectar which takes multiple forms. Cloven from the fragrance of this nectar is the liberation of oneself from the wickedness of life. At the early dawn of man; liberated were those among you who thought beyond.
