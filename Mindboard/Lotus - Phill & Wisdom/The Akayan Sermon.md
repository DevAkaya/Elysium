> Atonement Of The Forefathers

Prosperous were the ones who made peace the essence of their society. These were the biggest fruits from your forefathers, O Jasper! Verily, peace is the most blissful contribution we can make to the welfare and rights of every being. Indeed, peace is the desire of every heart, the hope of every nation and dominion, the promise of every politician; honest or deceitful, a pillar of every supplication and the outward beat of every religious agenda, Peace is the ultimate response and antagonist to many evils and suffering in life. Where evil, corrupts, destroys and tears apart, peace strengthens and restores. 

May Alterra remain steadfast in its goal of peace and eternally prevail through its dominion and beyond. Verily, peace is a concept that is multifaceted and extends beyond the mere absence of conflict or violence. It is a state of harmony and tranquillity that allows individuals and communities to thrive and flourish. It is the foundation upon which relationships are built, innovations are created, and we work towards a better future for all. 

However, peace is often elusive and fragile, constantly threatened by those who seek to sow discord and unrest through their actions and ideologies. Therefore, it should be the duty of every one of us to strive towards creating a more peaceful world, through actions both grand and small. This can be achieved through diplomacy and dialogue, community service and activism, or simply through the choice to act with kindness and understanding in our daily interactions. We all have the power to promote and nurture peace. Let us be ambassadors of peace and do our part in creating a world that is more just, compassionate, and harmonious. For it is only through peace that we can truly flourish and reach our full potential as human beings.

So it was said to the objectional ones; Uphold peace and unity as a quintessence of the mind. Such are multitudes of people who diverted from the path of serenity and righteousness. Among them were the corrupt and unjust leaders. Their resultant individuality strikes similitude to a discontent shell devoid of any goodness, Their spirits were sealed from tasting the greatest of nectar of life. 

Jasper replied, “What is this nectar O Sage?” So he _smiled_ broadly, content at his speech, and propounded:

Verily, it is this nectar's fragrance which takes multiple forms. Indeed, cloven from the fragrance of this nectar is the liberation of oneself from the wickedness of life. From the early dawn of humankind; liberated were those among you who's thinking rose beyond the nationalist borders of their nations. Surely, it is the prosperity of the mind that is found in liberation from the ignorance of humankind, and it's arrogance. Devoid of liberation, where those who indulged their minds with transgressions of their forefathers. Such were those who valued the enterprise over humanity, dogma over truth and racism over unity. They enveloped themselves in arrogance outwardly, but inwards we're truly in despair. 


Upon this epiphany, the learned inquired, “O Exalted! From where is this hatred and ignorance rented asunder?” Indeed, those among you emotional devotionalism


# <u> The Two Great Minds </u>

O Jasper, Among my kind therein abided two great minds Yerxa and Orion, whose hearts yearned greatly for fruition. Their excellence and worth reached the heavens, Yet fate denied them praise and fruits of acknowledgement. Their minds were seized by perseverance and vigour, so they sought the seeds of an eternal kingdom of contentment. In the distance, their eyes gazed upon an ocean of distinction, thereby laid water like sparkling silver and residing above them was a Dyson sphere like burning gold. Upon this horizon was the enchanting allure of success; its delicate rays were endowed with the vibrant hues flowing through the tapestry of existence.

As the days followed, cloven from the sight was the divergence of two paths. Blessed are they (Orion) who remains steadfast in passion, humility, and stridence; such people propounded “Verily this is nothing more than fleeting desires” Indeed, whoever (Yerxa) inequitably seeks against that, then those are the vanquished themselves. Within the soul of Yerxa beholding despair grew ignorance, arrogance, and denial as he increasingly chased the enchanting allure of success. 













In the pursuit of life's elusive wonders, we often find ourselves mesmerized by the enchanting allure of butterflies. Their delicate wings, adorned with vibrant hues, flutter gracefully through the tapestry of existence, seemingly just beyond our reach. Yet, in our fervent desire to capture these fleeting beauties, we may unwittingly drive them further away. For it is when we become consumed with the act of chasing, relentlessly pursuing the ephemeral, that the very essence of what we seek slips through our grasp.

However, let us contemplate a different path—a path that leads us to the artistry of creation, to the nurturing of our own metaphorical gardens. Instead of chasing butterflies, we channel our energy and devotion into building a sanctuary of serenity and beauty. We lay the foundations with intention, planting seeds of love, wisdom, and compassion, tending to them with care and patience.

As the garden of our existence begins to flourish, its radiance draws forth a magnetic force, inviting the graceful flutter of butterflies into our realm. With their delicate presence, they bring a sense of wonder and harmony, dancing upon the petals of our carefully nurtured dreams. Yet, even if they choose to elude us, even if they drift away on the currents of time, we are not left empty-handed.

For in the process of cultivating our garden, we have transformed ourselves. We have become architects of our own inner landscapes, artisans of personal growth. The very act of tending to our aspirations, cultivating our virtues, and nurturing our relationships has bestowed upon us a profound sense of fulfillment and purpose.

We come to realize that the true essence of beauty lies not solely in the external manifestations we seek, but in the intricate tapestry of our own being. It is in the creation of a life lived with authenticity, integrity, and compassion that we discover the everlasting wellspring of joy and contentment.

So, let us embark upon this philosophical journey of self-discovery and growth. Let us shift our focus from the ephemeral chase to the transformative act of cultivation. For in the pursuit of building our own gardens, we transcend the limitations of mere chasing, and embrace the profound realization that the truest and most enduring beauty resides within ourselves.



“If you spend your time chasing butterflies, they will fly away. If you spend your time building your garden, the butterflies will come to you. And if they don’t, you still have a beautiful garden.”
