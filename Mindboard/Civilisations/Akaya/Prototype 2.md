At an unknown period of Umar’s universe, Sentient beings were created directly by Umar, no one knows why he created this universe however these beings established a civilization that changed it all. These beings are a naturally powerful and mighty gardener type of race; they were naturally dispositioned to spread life and prosperity across the universe.  An unforeseen choice, however, was made, which the universe shall remain thankful for. A covenant was formed and a pledge to The Creator was made that states the Akayans' will uphold balance and justice within his dominion. In agreeing to the covenant, The Akaya were given many keys and secrets to the laws and nature of the hive mind that will allow them to prosper. Eons after their creation, Akaya grew at a rate with many technologies and feats under its reign, which allowed many planets throughout the cosmos to be terraformed and life be seeded throughout the universe. Eventually, the Akaya with their power and majesty created and programmed a mechanical-robotic form of themselves in their own image to advance the Akayan race. However, these types of Akayans' shared a very different approach to the biological Akayans, who they believed were inferior and obsolete. They believed, “life is a disease and mess that must be cleaned up or contained”.  Hence, the Akayans wiped off 3/4 of all biological Akayans' and ordered the remaining to be placed into an eternal hibernation at an unknown place in the universe.

As the flourishing nature of life, saw it's impending doom; One person would start it all for us. Behold the shining light of the Akaya; the upholder of law and order, someone even the mechanical-robotic Akayans respected; the commander of Akaya; Eden. Before the Akayans' were placed into their abyss; the mighty commander of Akaya had kept one goldilocks planet, reminiscent of hell, special to him. Exalted was he who raised his scepter high to the ether, and with one strike made earth into an ambassador of beauty, and created life and humans in his own vision afterward from Akayan technology. He lastly created primates and dinosaurs to cover the truth, as he affirmed in humans finding their own path.

His plans of nurture and glad tidings to his new creation humans seized to an abrupt end, for verily his mechanical-robotic counterparts were of arrogance who killed his father; and warned his failure of hasty arrival will surely mean the perishing of his only loved ones. He arrived to his impending abode, Exelon, and was placed into his desolate torpid. Surely these squanderers were also drowned in guilt and built pyramids and structures upon his tomb of majesty.
