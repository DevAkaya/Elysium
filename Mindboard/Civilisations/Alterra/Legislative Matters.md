> So let the Sapience, the ones endowed with intellect and wisdom, exalt their essence upon Alterra; O Mankind! Chosen are the ones who attain certainty for themselves or merit. They do not speak out of their whims or arrogance, but rather out of their modesty and knowledge; their light upon humanity. They are the ones who nurture the society of this dominion. Such are multitudes of people learned in the faculties of life, encompassing Philosophy and Sciences as well as the Spiritual arts. Blessed is the matter, they base their opinion on the collective process of moral reasoning and reviewing of the modern, ancient and religious scriptures. 
> 
> Those are the ones who have been chosen by the Eternal Majesty of Alterra. Indeed, you will find, they are the ones who align themselves with the universal harmony and order of humankind. 
> 
> They are the ones who seek the attainment of perfection and transcendence. Extol to them, for they are the ones who work for the common good and welfare. 
> 
> Blessed are them, for they are the ones who promote peace and harmony. They are the ones who uphold virtue and ethics.

Matter On Human Machine Interface/Atlas

- Alterra decrees that that society shall not have synthetic machinery installed or allow humans to meld with machines or brain interfaces. At the time of Elysium set, there existed talks within the Sapience of reviewing such decrees. The augmentation and improvement of the natural human condition is permitted and desired.

- Many advocates of such legislation exist because they believe that human intelligence and consciousness is more than just physical processes that can be replicated or enhanced by machines. They argue that there is something special and irreducible about the human mind that cannot be captured or simulated by artificial intelligence. They reject the idea that humans are essentially machines, or that machines can become essentially human.

- The society does not have neural links installed or allow humans to meld with machines or brain interfaces because they believe that human intelligence and creativity are shaped by the natural and social environment, and that integrating with machines would isolate them from the reality and diversity of life. 
-
- They value the human experience as a source of meaning and wisdom, and not as a problem to be solved or optimized by technology. They embrace the uncertainty and complexity of the world, and not the certainty and simplicity of algorithms.
