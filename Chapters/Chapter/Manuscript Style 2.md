By the blazing sun as it manifests itself. It's dazzling dyson rings and beauty shine brightly over the capital province of Alterra, casting a warm and peaceful glow over the cityscape. The alluring and harmonic ambience of nature and it's gardens of the deepest green finds an equilibrium with the distant sounds of spaceships and hovercars creating a unique and peaceful environment. Behold, citizens across the province arise to such a day, that of which is casual in Stellaris. Verily, Stellaris is a true testament to Alterra's power. Alterra's success of achieving a near utopian way of life is a testament to what human are truly capable of when united. Extol to them for their tireless efforts of it's dedicated and civilised people with its constitution and thereby Alterra grew fast. Multitudes of man are stricken with jealousy as mankind witness in awe the first successful endeavour in a civilisation of prosperity and peace. Indeed, the quintessence of mercy and tenderness runs deep through the heart of Stellaris's home planet, Stellaria. But this day was cloven with vigour when an unusual commotion in the capital forever changed the timeline for Alterra.

“Right, let's get to work” Exclaimed Elena. The camera crew hustles and gets the place ready for her daily stream; Elena suspended 117 stories above the ground in her office flat can’t help but gaze at the beautiful views her fans witness her at daily alongside her natural beauty and personality. ‘Hey, Christiane? Care to tell me what’s so interesting about that wall you’ve chosen?’ Elena was very unamused, prompting the frightened camera operator to turn her head reluctantly to Elena and mutters, ‘you in front of that wall is enough…’

Seen wearing a skimpy dress that shows off her curves and her ample chest. Elena *(rolling her eyes)* tosses her hair walking to the spot, with confidence exclaims, “Aww, you’re a sweet girl. Also true, but wrong. Simple is boring, the secret is the perfect angle. See? No distractions, no moving ships in orbit; just me… and my one billion fans.” The camera crew scrambles trying to find a better angle. Luckily, the spot is right in front of the giant flat screen on the wall, but still no good. “I hope that angle is good, Christiane. If not, I can always move,” says Elena. The camera crew is ready and the livestream begins. “Alright, I’m ready. Let’s go.” She says to the camera operator, who nods nervously and switches on the camera.

Hello, my billions of fans from all over Alterra! I hope you're having a great morning, cause this latest feed won't your usual. I want to talk about something quite revolutionary… Our scientists in The Institute Of Stellaris recently delved further into parallel unive-r [Sirens Begin To Alarm].

“What in the fuck was that?!” The camera crew suddenly panics and is interrupted from sirens and loud whirring roaring abruptly from the atmosphere. The camera operator Christiane turns to observe something beyond all expectation. An unidentified object enters the Alterran atmosphere, its sleek and abstract exterior glistening in the sun as it descends towards the city. The sirens grow louder and more urgent as the people of Stellaris propound that indeed this is no typical visitor. Panic and fear begin to spread through the hearts of people as they run for cover, unsure of what this strange vessel might bring.

Elena's stream is interrupted as the camera operator struggles to keep the camera steady. “Oh my god, what is that thing?” Elena exclaims, her face contorting with shock and fear. The camera pans upwards, trying to get a better view of the approaching spaceship.

As it gets closer, it becomes clear that this is no ordinary spacecraft. Its size alone casts, in to the hearts of the one who witnesses, horror and awe. Behold! Its advanced technology and design is unlike anything anyone in Alterra ever thought of. The sirens continue to blare as the spaceship makes its descent, the people of Alterra unable to tear their eyes away from the incredible sight.

Finally, with a mighty roar, the spaceship touches down in the centre of the city. The ground trembles beneath its weight, and a cloud of dust and debris fills the air. The people of Alterra can only wait with bated breath to see what this mysterious visitor has in store for them.

As the hazy debris settled, the hearts of those in awe found relief from their dread. Yet Christiane's hands trembled as she beheld the strange spaceship descending upon the city, its sirens blaring in the background. Fear and anxiety took dominion of her heart as she thought of her son, who was meant to be at the Institute of Stellaris, the very place towards which the alien vessel seemed to be heading.

Turning to Elena, Christiane voices her worry in a shaky voice. Elena, I'm so worried about my son. He's at the Institute of Stellaris, and that's where that spaceship seems to be headed. What if he's in danger?"

Elena looks at Christiane with a mixture of concern and annoyance. "Look, Christiane, I know you're worried about your son, but he's in good hands. He's at the Institute of Stellaris, with Jasper, the brightest mind in Alterra. If anyone can keep him safe, it's Jasper. So don't worry, okay? Everything will be fine."

But Christiane can't help the nagging feeling of fear that grips her heart. She knows that Jasper is brilliant, but what if something goes wrong? What if her son is hurt, or worse?

Meanwhile, the spaceship has landed in the centre of the city, and a crowd of people has gathered around it, watching in awe and fear. The spaceship is like nothing anyone has ever seen before - sleek, abstract, and advanced beyond belief.
