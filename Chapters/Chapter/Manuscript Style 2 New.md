By the blazing sun as it manifests itself. It's dazzling dyson rings and beauty shine brightly over the capital province of Alterra, casting a warm and peaceful glow over the cityscape. The alluring and harmonic ambience of nature and it's gardens of the deepest green finds an equilibrium with the distant sounds of spaceships and hovercars, creating a unique and peaceful environment. Behold, citizens across the province arise to such a day, that of which is casual in Stellaris. Verily, Stellaris is a true testament to Alterra's power. Alterra's success of achieving a near utopian way of life is a testament to what humans are truly capable of when united. Extol to them for their tireless efforts of it's dedicated and civilised people with its constitution which thereby Alterra grew fast. Multitudes of man are stricken with jealousy as mankind witnesses in awe the first successful endeavour in a civilisation of prosperity and peace. Indeed, the quintessence of mercy and tenderness runs deep through the heart of Stellaris's home planet, Stellaria. But this day was cloven with vigour when an unusual commotion in the capital forever changed the timeline for Alterra.

Exalted is the vast reign of Alterra, that of which lays it's capital star system ; The Stellar System. Millions of citizens, therein, immerse themselves with their Fusion Lenses. Behold! These are the revolutionary eye contacts that allow thee Alterrans near full immersion into a technological metaverse where many fulfil their wildest dreams, but before they do; a lot of them get their daily dose of Stellaris' largest influencer… Elena

“Let's get to work!” Elena proclaimed. The camera crew hastened and readied the scene for her daily stream; Elena, raised 117 stories above the land in her office residence, could not restrain from beholding the magnificent scenes of Stellaris her admirers witness her at daily with her natural elegance and disposition. “O, Christiane? Apprise me with what is so alluring about that wall you have picked out?” Elena was very discontented, inducing the terrified camera operator to swivel her head reluctantly to Elena and murmurs, “You ahead of that wall are enough…”


Seen wearing a skimpy dress that shows off her curves and her ample chest. Elena *(rolling her eyes)* tosses her hair walking to the spot, with confidence exclaims, “Aww, you’re a sweet girl. Also true, but wrong. Simple is boring, the secret is the perfect angle. See? No distractions, no moving ships in orbit; just me… and my one billion fans.” The camera crew scrambles trying to find a better angle. Luckily, the spot is right in front of the giant hologram screen situated on the wall, but still no good. “I hope that angle is good, Christiane. If not, I can always move,” says Elena. The camera crew is ready and the livestream begins. “Alright, I’m ready. Let’s go.” She says to the camera operator, who nods nervously and switches on the camera.

Greetings to my billions of fans from all over Alterra! I hope you're having a great morning, cause this latest feed won't your usual. I want to talk about something quite revolutionary… Our scientists in The Institute Of Stellaris recently delved further into parallel unive-r [Sirens Begin To Alarm].

“What in the fuck was that?!” Stricken with panic is the hearts of the camera crew who are interrupted from sirens and loud whirring roaring abruptly from the atmosphere. Christiane turns to observe something beyond what her faculties can propound. An unidentified object enters the Alterran atmosphere, its sleek and abstract exterior glistening in the sun as it descends towards the city. The sirens exert its rage and urgency as the citizens of Stellaris propound that indeed this is no typical visitor. The pangs of panic and fear seize the minds of the citizens as they run for cover, unsure of what this strange vessel might bring.

Elena's stream is interrupted as the camera operator struggles to keep the camera steady. “Oh my god, what is that thing?” Elena exclaims, her face contorting with shock and fear. The camera pans upwards, trying to get a better view of the approaching spaceship.

As the vessel reaches it's lawful destination. It's empuzzling nature is made clear to all. Behold! Its size alone casts, in to the hearts of the one who witnesses, horror and awe. Such a ship strikes similitude to the dreams of the most profound. Indeed, within Alterra, you find not anything of its likeness. The sirens increase in rage and blare as the spaceship makes its descent, the people of Alterra are unable to tear their eyes away from the incredible sight.

With a mighty roar from the heavens, the spaceship descends in the centre of the city. The ground trembles beneath its weight, and a cloud of dust and debris fills the air. The Citizens of Alterra can only wait with an abrupted breath to see what this mirage has in store for them.

As the hazy debris settled, the hearts of those in awe found relief from their dread. A multitude of people congregated around the vessel, indeed stricken with awe and fear. Propounded with certainty of those were they who witnesses, it's sleek, abstract, and advanced essence beyond belief. Unlike the majority, The shackles of burden had still chained Christiane as fear and anxiety took dominion of her heart. Thoughts of her son were rented asunder in her mind, who was meant to be at the Institute of Stellaris, the very place next to which the alien vessel seemed to had landed.

She faces Elena and with apprehensive tremble and propounds, “O Elena, I am so fearful about my son Hugo. He situates at the Institute of Stellaris, and that is where that spacecraft seems to be heading. What if he is in jeopardy?” Elena gazed at Christiane with a combination of solicitude and vexation. “Listen, Christiane, I know you are fearful about your son, but he is in good hands. He is at the Institute of Stellaris, with Jasper, the most luminous intellect in Alterra. If anyone can preserve him safe, it is Jasper. So do not fear, everything will be fine.”

But Christiane could not restrain the impending feeling of dread that seized her heart. She knew that Jasper was brilliant, but what if something went wrong? What if her son was harmed, or worse?


“What da the fuck!” As Hugo reclined in his chair, half asleep, a sudden jolt seized his chest, and an overwhelming boom was rented asunder outside his window. He withdrew from of his comfort, hastening to the glass and gazing through the curtains. His breath situated in his larynx as he beheld a dense plume of smoke ascending up from the city centre, veiling the sun and casting a murky pall over the structures from his view. Quickly, he reached for his phone on the nightstand, hoping to call his mother, but no signal came through. Perplexed and anxious, he pondered over the cause of this chaos and worried about his mother's safety.

The Institute of Stellaris is a tremendous marvel that overtopped the buildings around it. It was the focus of scientific inquiry and novelty in Alterra, and the abode of some of the most sagacious minds in the human race. Jasper was one of them, a young marvel who had attained astounding findings in astrophysics and quantum mechanics. He was also Hugo’s guide and companion, and had invited him to join his team at the institute.

Hugo was captivated by Jasper’s work, but he also had a defiant disposition. He frequently disputed Jasper’s methods and theories, and sometimes defied him to arguments. He also liked to roam the institute by himself, seeking secrets and enigmas. He had a talent for encountering trouble, but he always escaped it with his charisma and ingenuity.

He resolved to go look for Jasper, hoping he would have some explanations. He ran out of his room and through the corridors, avoiding other students and staff who were also terrified. He reached the main entrance of the building, where he saw Jasper walking out with a backpack flung over his shoulder.

“Jasper! Wait up!” Hugo shouted as he ran after him.

Jasper turned around and saw Hugo coming near him.

“Hugo? What are you doing here? You should be in your room,” Jasper said.

“I need to talk to you. What’s happening out there? Is it an assault? A calamity?” Hugo asked.

Jasper looked at him with a grave expression.

“It’s neither,” he said. “It’s something much worse.”

He pointed at the sky, where a large metallic object was hovering over the city.

“It’s an alien spaceship.”


















Hugo felt a sudden jolt in his chest as he heard a deafening boom outside his window. He jumped out of his bed and ran to the glass, peering through the curtains. He gasped as he saw a thick plume of smoke rising from the heart of the city, obscuring the sun and casting a dark shadow over the buildings. He grabbed his phone from his nightstand and tried to call his mother, but there was no signal. He wondered what was going on, and if she was safe.

He decided to go look for Jasper, his mentor and friend at the Institute of Stellaris. Jasper was a brilliant scientist who had invited Hugo to join his team of researchers at the institute, a place of wonder and innovation. Hugo admired Jasper’s work, but he also had a curious and rebellious nature. He often questioned Jasper’s methods and theories, and sometimes challenged him to debates. He also liked to explore the institute on his own, looking for secrets and mysteries. He had a knack for finding trouble, but he always managed to get out of it with his charm and wit.

He ran out of his room and down the hallways, dodging other students and staff who were also panicking. He reached the main entrance of the building, where he saw Jasper walking out with a backpack slung over his shoulder.

“Jasper! Wait up!” Hugo yelled as he ran after him.

Jasper turned around and saw Hugo approaching him.

“Hugo? What are you doing here? You should be in your room,” Jasper said.

“I need to talk to you. What’s happening out there? Is it an attack? A natural disaster?” Hugo asked.

Jasper looked at him with a serious expression.

“It’s neither,” he said. “It’s something much worse.”

He pointed at the sky, where a large metallic object was hovering over the city.

“It’s an alien spaceship.”
