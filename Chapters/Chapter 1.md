Chapter One

The Resonance 


A few centuries before, while Alterra was rejoicing many technological feats under its reign, many much smaller civilizations and planets including Earth were in dire unrest, and the outer planets had been beyond even the most unrealistic corporate dream. Then Solomon Epstein had built his little modified fusion drive, popped it on the back of his three-man yacht, and turned it on. With a good scope, you could still see his ship going at a marginal percentage of the speed of light, heading out into the big empty. The best, longest funeral in the history of mankind. Fortunately, he’d left the plans on his home computer. The Epstein Drive hadn’t given humanity the stars, but it had delivered the planets.

__**The Largest Mass Genocide in Alterra's History**__ 

+ Humans on earth not learning their ways led to environmental disasters and billions of people sadly becoming displaced. Many of them fell into despair. Much of this fixed by Alterra's Humanitarian Aid and the people who lost their homes,  Alterra had offered them to migrate to one of their biggest ecological projects ever known across the cosmos, a paradise star system resembling humans image of paradise that will feed and be home to 10s of billions of new Alterra citizens. 

It is found out that the Centaurians evaded their deletion still controlled many enslaved civilizations, one of them being found on a planet in this Paradise System. Jasper along with many holds the Oasis system very close to their hearts, with them having many memories and family members that reside there. Alterra was very alarmed on how they couldn't find this system at first to use as a template but dismissed it not finding the reason. This system belonged to an advanced civilization called [N/A] and had been enslaved by the Centuarians, desperately begging Alterra to remove the hub off their planet that controlled the minds of their elders. After Alterra had finally finished, their project before they started preparing for the mass migration of these beings, they helped out the species and destroyed the hub not knowing the consequences. Out of void came a swarm of starships from the Centuarians who seeked revenge and before everyone's eyes, the entire solar system was turned to dust and killed 30 billion citizens along with an entire species including Jaspers family. 

+ One thing that became a little unsettling to Alterra Scientists is just how quiet the vast valleys of space had been discovered to be and they don't have an answer as to why they've only been in contact with a few dozen intelligent species... When the Centurions [new name in the making] were at it's prime, they did not want other civilizations rising to advancement, however keep them as their primitive trophies. Akayans over time developed a labyrinth system across 1000s of habitable planets that prevented them from developing further then their solar system .
