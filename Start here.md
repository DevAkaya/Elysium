If you manged to end up on this repo then congrats not sure how you did so. Within this folder is my list of thoughts that I'd pondered over a few years many of them faded due to my stress and unfortunate circumstances. Hence, I've decided to start getting them into writing format.

Many of them pondered when I was 14-15 but never gave it more thought until 17-18 where I've decided to start writing them however leaving it due to burdens in life.

It's this amalgamation of ideological propositions which will render the bedrock of my books messages to the reader.

- This folder should not be taken as extracts rather brain dumps and notes for when I execute the planning of the book. There will be parts that do not follow my liturgical format in hopes of transferring all my ponderance and stored mental notes onto written format within timeframes.

- Due to these being written very spontaneously and being brain dumps; many may be unfinished and further explored.
