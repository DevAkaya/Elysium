The Chapter Of Cynicism
*Evade if required as such words may be an imposition* 

> Mental Reminder/Origin Of Story: You were broken apart/having a breakdown coming to terms with your horrific life. My mind was in too many places and I may need to break this apart.

-----------------------------------------------------------------


Abstain from pondering the conundrums of reality in excess. Indeed, within the affair of such matters resides a grotesque epiphany that only consumes and intoxicates. Surely I fear for you the torment and an imposition of such grievous matters.  

Within his (Akaya) life resided a repository of dark and scarring nights that of which cast forth a fleeting demon overbearing in stature named nihilism. His quintessence flew through the weaves of Akaya consuming a biased distribution of his mind. Blessed are those who are free from the shackles of consuming thoughts. Indeed, if such a grotesque epiphany were to seize the strongest of minds; despair for even the atoms is expected.

So if it was said to Akaya “from which ideological substrate is your neurotic sophistry brought forth?“ Say: “O Foolish Bastard! Adorned for you is the love of adamancy and disfigured for you is the gift of graciousness”

Propounded by your benefactor (The Demon) is the woeful; most corrosive affair that life is merely a biased accident, gushed forth by sexual desire, that verily the universe and its residents have no moral order, no truth, no spirituality, no God.  
  
That the long-suffering and all of the mankind shall be driven by insatiable lusts and that they (The: Unliberated) shall be drunk on or tormented by the arrogance of power, the hypocritical, the deluded, the self-seeking. Tormented by a symphony of vast anxieties and suffering that continues until their death. 

A sickness (Literally: An idea pathogen) among them will seize the unliberated from which they propound 

They are convinced that the gratification of desire is life's sole aim, bound by a hundred shackles of hope, enslaved by their greed, they squander their time dishonestly piling up mountains of wealth.  
  
"Today I got this desire, this bounty and privilege, and tomorrow I will get that one; all these riches, whims are mine, and soon I will have even more. Already I have squandered these enemies, and soon I will squander the rest.”

We reside in a dominion (Literally: The World) that is indeed bountiful in reward to the tyrants and the sociopaths (Including the latter). Thereby, you will surely find multitudes of people who are stricken with ignorance, the ego, and foolishness; These are animals who are patrons to only themselves. Thereby, this is a writing of which it's substrates are nested in Akaya's ideology founded upon his philosophical pillars.
