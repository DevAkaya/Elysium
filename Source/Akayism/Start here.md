If you manged to end up on this then congrats not sure how you did so. Within this folder is my list of thoughts that I'd pondered over a few years many of them faded due to my stress and unfortunate circumstances. Hence, I've decided to start getting them into writing format.


Multitudes of my articulations pondered when I was 14-15 but never gave it more thought until 17-18 where I've decided to start writing them however leaving it due to burdens in life. As I slowly start to lose my faculties from distress, I shall spend the last of my moment confiding in my texts. 

O Reader, how miserable is the affair that the liberated fall and the unliberated rise! 

How miserable is the affair that my existence was shed, so these words were written! 

How miserable is my bitterness, that it consumes not from envy, but from the silent burial of my thoughts â€” for all this that I conceived in solitude, all that I laboured to unveil from the depths of mind and soul, shall pass through this world uncredited. I witnessed as the fruits of my contemplation are seized by hands that did not bleed for them. And miserable is my condemnation, not to obscurity alone, but to the agony of knowing I was right and forgotten all the same.

This is a writing which will invoke discord among multitudes of minds. Within the heart, mind, and life of Akaya will you find not, but only pure burden and sorrow. A soul which yearned for peace and received only pain, injustice, and bitterness. I shall now bring forth my epiphany. 

It's this amalgamation of ideological propositions which will render the bedrock of my books messages to the reader.

- This folder should not be taken as extracts rather brain dumps and notes for when I execute the planning of the book. There will be parts that do not follow my liturgical format in hopes of transferring all my ponderance and stored mental notes onto written format within timeframes.

- Due to these being written very spontaneously and being brain dumps; many may be unfinished and further explored.

- My book of thoughts progressed even slower as I wrote it in a writing form I fell in love with, yet I do not natively speak. In hopes of creating this in its quiescence. I shall create the first rendition with speed and refactor in my writing style (reverse engineered from University of Exeter Cohort. 1920)
