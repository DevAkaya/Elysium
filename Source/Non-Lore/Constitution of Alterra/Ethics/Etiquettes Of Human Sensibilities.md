You are obligated in trying to treat others where possible and appropriate with gentleness and kindness, abstaining from behaving in an arrogant or superior manner to other human beings that goes against the ethos of Alterra. 

Strive to not be among those who show not any awareness of how lucky one must be to succeed at anything in life, no matter how hard and diligent one works. Indeed, one must be lucky to even yield the basic privilege of beingÂ **able to see.** One must be lucky to be of sane mind, to not have the likes of ataxia, or to not have been burdened by the evils of other human beings. 

It is incumbent upon us to refrain from attacking or making assumptions about others based on their protected characteristics, should foolishness not reign the protected characteristic. We must listen to and respect the perspectives and experiences of others, even if we do not agree with them, should they not infringe the UN Human Rights. Be open to learning from and about those who may be different from us so that you may increase in wisdom.

It is our duty to challenge and speak out against bigotry and discrimination whenever we encounter it, educating ourselves about the harmful effects of arrogance and bigotry on individuals and communities. 

If we have privilege and power, it is our responsibility to use it to support and uplift marginalised individuals and groups, becoming allies to those who may be targeted by bigotry and discrimination. It is important that we work together with others to create a more inclusive and accepting community, avoiding any behaviour that belittles, marginalises, or harms others. 

We must strive to create inclusive spaces, working towards environments that are welcoming and accepting of all backgrounds and identities. We must also acknowledge and understand our own biases and privileges, recognizing the impact that our own experiences and beliefs may have on our views on diversity.
