1. Alterra stands for respect and dignity above all else. You are expected to respect and be civilized for every member, regardless of what protected characteristics they have. If you wish to be respected back, it is imperative that you first give respect.

2. Any form of hate speech, including racial slurs or derivatives thereof, sexist or homophobic statements, and other similar derogatory behavior's, is deplorable. Alterra is strict and has zero tolerance for toxic and objectionable members that are out of their way to actively disrespect others. You have been warned.

3. Any form of content that contains NSFW or anything of a sexual or gory nature is strictly forbidden and, if convicted of this infringement, will face harsh consequences.

4. With Alterra's vision of setting an example for communities, we are much more strict and firm with our conduct. At Alterra, we strive for diversity and inclusivity, and we encourage your interactions on this channel to be open-minded and guided by these values. We encourage free expression for members, and embrace and honor our differences, opinions, and diverse backgrounds. Therefore, discussions are welcome on these ideas. Be aware that staff reserve the right to warn and ban users discretionally.

5. Every aspect of chat, including voice chat, is governed by the same rules. Voice changers are allowed if they are not loud/obnoxious. Under no circumstances is ear rape or VC harassment allowed, whether it be through a meme in chat or through VC.

6. Alterra, strictly following its ethos and values, means it values the comfort of those on the server. Therefore, your status, profile picture, and display name should be in line with the rules and values of Alterra. A display name should also be easily readable and mentionable, and should not imitate other users.

7. Alterra will tolerate any unsolicited advertisements, no matter the reason or context, unless certified by HQ. You may post your content on the media channel if it applies to that channel.

8. You may not raid or show malignant or aggressive intent on any non-Alterra premises in the name of Alterra. Alterra is firmly devoted to being natural and welcoming all communities while strengthening ties.

9. You are not allowed to promote, distribute, or administer access to any illegal content or behaviour. This is very likely to get you kicked off Discord, and in extreme cases get you reported to law enforcement.

10. Aside from the rules of Alterra, we request you take a look at the official discord guidelines to use this service correctly: [ https://discordapp.com/guidelines ]( https://discordapp.com/guidelines " https://discordapp.com/guidelines" )

11. You must not spam anything on the server, whether that be messages, emojis, pictures, or anything necessary or unnecessary. In any circumstance, it is not allowed for you to commit such acts. Give other members a chance.

12. Disrespecting or pinging the Creator DevAkaya or any member of Alterra Palace shall be dealt with. These people put their time and effort into ensuring an optimal status for Alterra. Hating or infringing on rule one will cause a server kick/ban depending on the situation.
