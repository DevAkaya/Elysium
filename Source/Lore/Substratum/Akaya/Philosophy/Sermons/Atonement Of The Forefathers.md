## **The following extracts from Elysium presents my topic on peace being the quintessence of a prosperous society. Enjoy!**

Prosperous were the ones who made peace the essence of their society. These were the biggest fruits from your forefathers. Verily, nothing is more exalted upon a blessed nation than peace (Literally: The Quintessence). Wonderous is the matter of peace, for it is surely the most blissful contribution to the welfare and rights of every being. Indeed, peace is the desire of every heart, the hope of every nation and dominion, the promise of every politician; honest or deceitful, a pillar of every supplication and the outward beat of every religious agenda, Peace is the ultimate response and antagonist to many evils and suffering in life. Where evil, corrupts, destroys and tears apart, peace strengthens and restores. 

May the wise (Alterra) remain steadfast in its goal of peace and eternally prevail through its dominion and beyond. Say to them: Indeed peace is a concept embodied in multitudes of forms that of which resides beyond the mere absence of conflict or violence. It is a state of harmony and tranquillity that allows oneself and it's benefactors to thrive and flourish. It is the foundation upon which relationships are built, innovations are created, and humankind works towards a better future for all. 

However, fragility is the quintessence of peace. It is thy who is constantly threatened from those who seek to sow discord and unrest through their actions and ideologies. 

It is incumbent and a duty on you to strive towards creating a more peaceful world, through actions both grand and small. Say, “Oh, peace how may I uphold you?”

O best among you, are five kinds of pious men who render devotional service unto Me—the diplomat, the rightful activist, the infectious desirer of wisdom and kindness, the inquisitive, and he who is searches for thy knowledge of the Absolute (Non-platonic form of reality). And those who strive in my path will render forth a world that is more just, compassionate, and harmonious.

So it was said to the objectional ones; Uphold peace and unity as a quintessence of the mind. Such are multitudes of people who diverted from the path of serenity and righteousness. Among them were the corrupt and unjust. The essence of such tyrants strikes similitude to a discontent shell devoid of any goodness, Indeed, such minds are sealed from tasting the greatest of nectar of life. 

Jasper replied, “What is this nectar O Sage?” So he _smiled_ broadly, content at his speech, and propounded:

Verily, it is this nectar's fragrance which takes multiple forms. Indeed, cloven from the fragrance of this nectar is the liberation of oneself from the wickedness of life. From the early dawn of humankind; #liberated were those among you who's thinking rose beyond the nationalist borders of their nations. Surely, it is the prosperity of the mind that is found in liberation from the ignorance of humankind, and it's arrogance. Devoid of liberation, where those who indulged their minds with transgressions of their forefathers. Such were those who valued the enterprise over humanity, dogma over truth and racism over unity. They enveloped themselves in arrogance outwardly, but inwards we're truly in despair. 


Upon this epiphany, the learned inquired, “O Exalted! From where is this hatred and ignorance rented asunder?” Indeed, those among you emotional devotionalism [continue pondering and brainstorm ideas of this origin for emotional devotionalism]
