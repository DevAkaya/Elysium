I hereby declare and bring forth in all ponderance and virtue by Akaya, the Akayan Universal Rights. O best among you, are those who ponder and submit themselves to peace. Among those who objected were the corrupt and unjust (Literally: The unliberated).  Verily, the essence of such unliberated are truly among the losers, Indeed, such minds are sealed from tasting the greatest of nectar of life.

I shall now bring forth the Akayan Universal Rights:

EPP — Every passable personnel 
DOA  — Domain Of Akaya
16 — Age of Freedom

> EPP is entitled to the right of life, liberty, maximal wellbeing within appropriacy and security. 

> EPP regardless of their species biases (biases such as protected characteristics) has the right to protection within DOA from violence, discrimination and other harm, whether by DOA or by any individual or group.

> No EPP shall be subjected to torture or to cruel or degrading treatment or punishment in accordance with the species.


> EPP has the right to bodily and mental integrity, autonomy, and self-determination irrespective of biological expression or the sex characteristics.

DOA Shall:

-  Ensure that the DOA protects EPP, including all children, from all forms of forced or otherwise involuntary modification through coercive of their natural body or sex characteristics; Matters such as circumcision and any alteration of the body may only be applied after the age of freedom (16)
- Ensure that the best interest of the personnel is not manipulated in order to justify aforementioned matters that are in conflict with the personnel's sight to bodily integrity;


> EPP has the right to bodily and mental integrity, autonomy, and self-determination irrespective of biological expression or the sex characteristics.



> EPP should be given facilities by DOA (through causes and innovation) to allow every EPP their right to Central Capabilities and anticipated experiences. Such example is allowing every human being to seek balanced work life and leisure.

- Access and facilitation of EEP to find connection, affection, love, and intimacy.  (Self Person Project for example)
- Within DOA all personnel must be able and facilitated to change locations freely, in addition to, having sovereignty over one’s body which includes being secure against assault (for example, sexual assault, child sexual abuse, domestic violence and the opportunity for sexual satisfaction).
