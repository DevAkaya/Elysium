Description: Luca is a 19-year-old male who's a computational physics' student studying at the Institute of Stellaris. Luca is someone destined for a great future ahead, being blessed in almost all areas of life, although Jasper is very open-minded he's an extreme patriot of Alterra that is angered by the slight objection to his homeland. His good looks and beautiful charming personality is unlike anything else.

Height: 6ft
Sexuality: Bisexual

Hair: Slightly Wavy Hair

People in his local area and beyond all know Japser for his great theories he's made on the universe and the field of computation. After the catastrophic event on the planet Scape, Jasper through [yet to be compiled on the story line] gets invited to the HQ of Alterra's Scientific Agency where he meets some of Alterra's greatest mind to solve and find clues to the anomaly found on Scape's capital OreScape which caused the sentinels on that planet to become hostile. Along the way Jasper discovers many deep secrets to Alterra and in the process causes even more issues for people (the part which pisses off the audience but keeps them engaged)


It was a beautiful day as Jasper looked out the window of the Institute of Stellaris. The sun was shining and the birds were singing. It was a perfect day for studying computational physics.

Jasper had always been interested in physics, and he was particularly fascinated by the mysteries of Alterra. He had read all sorts of books on the subject, and he was determined to learn everything he could about it.

But today, Jasper learned something that would change his life forever. He discovered that Alterra is not what it seems...


Here is yet another possible opening chapter for your story:

```markdown
Jasper strolled down the hallway of the Institute of Stellaris with a smile on his face. He had just finished his latest project in Computational Physics, and he was eager to show it to his professor.

He loved studying at the Institute of Stellaris. It was the most prestigious and advanced university of technology in Alterra, and it offered him endless opportunities to learn and grow.

He had always been passionate about physics and computation, and he had a natural talent for both. He had mastered complex concepts and theories at an early age, and he had impressed many professors and peers with his original ideas and insights.

He had also earned the admiration and affection of many people in Alterra. He was widely regarded as a handsome and charming young man, with a friendly and charismatic personality.

He had blue eyes that shone with intelligence and curiosity. He had slightly wavy hair that framed his face nicely. He wore a black leather jacket over a red shirt that accentuated his muscular physique.

He was bisexual, but he didn't care much about labels or stereotypes. He liked people for who they were, not what they were. He had dated both boys and girls in the past, but he hadn't found anyone who could truly capture his heart.

He hoped to find someone who could share his passion for learning and exploring.

He also hoped to make Alterra proud. He loved his homeland more than anything. He believed that Alterra was the best place in the galaxy, a shining example of progress and harmony.

He hated anyone who dared to criticize or oppose Alterra. He thought they were ignorant or malicious, or both. He especially despised the rebels who were trying to overthrow the government and disrupt the peace.

He wished he could do something to stop them...
