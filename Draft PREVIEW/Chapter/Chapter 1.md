Citizens across the province arise to another day in Alterra. The sun and it's dazzling dyson rings shines brightly over the capital province of Alterra, casting a warm and peaceful glow over the cityscape. The alluring and harmonic ambience of nature and it's gardens of the deepest green finding an equilibrium with the distant sounds of spaceships and hovercars creates a unique and peaceful environment. Stellaris is a true testament to Alterra's power. Alterra's success of achieving a near utopian way of life is a testament to what human are truly capable of when united. Thanks to the tireless efforts of it's dedicated and civilized people with its constitution, Alterra grew fast. Humans across many systems watch in awe and jealousy, witnessing humanity's first stable and truly substantial civilization.

Millions, of citizens across the star system known as The Stellar System as part of their usual routine switch on their Fusion Lenses. These are revolutionary eye contacts that allow Alterrans near full immersion into a technological world where many fulfill their wildest dreams, but before they do; a lot of them get their daily dose of Stellaris' largest influencer… Elena

“Right, let's get to work” Exclaimed Elena. The camera crew hustles and gets the place ready for her daily stream; Elena suspended 117 stories above the ground in her office flat can’t help but gaze at the beautiful views her fans witness her at daily alongside her natural beauty and personality. ‘Hey, Christiane? Care to tell me what’s so interesting about that wall you’ve chosen?’ Elena was very unamused, prompting the frightened camera operator to turn her head reluctantly to Elena and mutters, ‘you in front of that wall is enough…’

Seen wearing a skimpy dress that shows off her curves and her ample chest. Elena *(rolling her eyes)* tosses her hair walking to the spot, with confidence exclaims, “Aww, you’re a sweet girl. Also true, but wrong. Simple is boring, the secret is the perfect angle. See? No distractions, no moving ships in orbit; just me… and my one billion fans.” The camera crew scrambles trying to find a better angle. Luckily, the spot is right in front of the giant flat screen on the wall, but still no good. “I hope that angle is good, Christiane. If not, I can always move,” says Elena. The camera crew is ready and the livestream begins. “Alright, I’m ready. Let’s go.” She says to the camera operator, who nods nervously and switches on the camera.

Hello, my billions of fans from all over Alterra! I hope you're having a great morning, cause this latest feed won't your usual. I want to talk about something quite revolutionary… Our scientists in The Institute Of Stellaris recently delved further into parallel unive-r [Sirens Begin To Alarm].

“What in the fuck was that?!” The camera crew suddenly panics and is interrupted from sirens and loud whirring roaring abruptly from the atmosphere. The camera operator Christiane turns to observe something beyond all expectation.
