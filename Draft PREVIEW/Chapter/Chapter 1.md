The year is currently 2417. A few centuries before that, humanity on earth did not amend its ways fast enough and mother nature took its revenge. Despair did not show mercy to even the most remote trenches on earth. Alterra however was prospering and the ether saw it.


A hundred and fifty years before, when the parochial disagreements
between Earth and Mars had been on the verge of war, the Belt had been a far
horizon of tremendous mineral wealth beyond viable economic reach, and the
outer planets had been beyond even the most unrealistic corporate dream. Then
Solomon Epstein had built his little modified fusion drive, popped it on the back
of his three-man yacht, and turned it on. With a good scope, you could still see
his ship going at a marginal percentage of the speed of light, heading out into the
big empty. The best, longest funeral in the history of mankind. Fortunately, he’d
left the plans on his home computer. The Epstein Drive hadn’t given humanity
the stars, but it had delivered the planets.
Three-quarters of a kilometer long, a quarter of a kilometer wide-roughly
shaped like a fire hydrant-and mostly empty space inside, the Canterbury was a
retooled colony transport. Once, it had been packed with people, supplies,
schematics, machines, environment bubbles, and hope. Just under twenty million
people lived on the moons of Saturn now. The Canterbury had hauled nearly a
million of their ancestors there. Forty-five million on the moons of Jupiter. One
moon of Uranus sported five thousand, the farthest outpost of human
civilization, at least until the Mormons finished their generation ship and headed
for the stars and freedom from procreation restrictions.
And then there was the Belt.
If you asked OPA recruiters when they were drunk and feeling expansive,
they might say there were a hundred million in the Belt. Ask an inner planet
census taker, it was nearer to fifty million. Any way you looked, the population
was huge and needed a lot of water.
So now the Canterbury and her dozens of sister ships in the Pur’n’Kleen
Water Company made the loop from Saturn’s generous rings to the Belt and back
hauling glaciers, and would until the ships aged into salvage wrecks.
Jim Holden saw some poetry in that.
“Holden?”
He turned back to the hangar deck. Chief Engineer Naomi Nagata towered
over him. She stood almost two full meters tall, her mop of curly hair tied back
into a black tail, her expression halfway between amusement and annoyance.
She had the Belter habit of shrugging with her hands instead of her shoulders.
“Holden, are you listening, or just staring out the window?”
“There was a problem,” Holden said. “And because you’re really, really
