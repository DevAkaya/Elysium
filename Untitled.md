By the way, everyone, the results are finally here and fully calibrated/adjusted (considering the challenges with DNA testing for South Asians) before I left! ðŸŽ‰

I hadn't found the time to update everyoneâ€”especially my familyâ€”until now, so Iâ€™m writing up this while relaxing outside.




So context: Being a geek about genealogy/biology and hopefully studying it way later in life purely for passion. I've always wondered pretty much my life about my true origins. It was until recently I chipped in for a raw DNA file then ran it through multiple tools (mixing and calibrating the results) that can tell me in depth that question, and FNALLY have a life long question and wow... it shocked me in a good way.

So why all this hassle when companies like 23andMe, AncestryDNA already give you it? Well in very vague short without the boring details DNA results for South Asians are much tricker, it's not a fault of the science rather the nature of South Asian ancestry and White Europeans (The Anglophone) being the majority of data for the main companies. Means the result are as good as the dataset and getting a good one for south asian will require deeper analysis.
